## 剑术协会



西交利物浦大学剑术协会，简称西浦剑协，成立于2017年。社团成立初期得到了学校和来自世界各地的剑术爱好者的大力支持，现已拥有稳定良好的练习体系，安全器材以及环境。

社团分为兵击部，与剑道部。兵击部通过历史资料“重构”各种历史武术体系，并加以学习练习和对抗。而剑道部练习的剑道是传统的竞技性器械武术，通过体系化的训练并进行一对一的比赛通过计分得出胜负。两部社员间保持长期友好密切的关系，也会定期在一起组织社团团建活动。

我们的社团活动也十分丰富多彩，兵击部的社员在选好自己想要学习或体验的兵器后（目前社团开设的兵器分为东亚长刀，德式长剑，英式军刀，意大利迅捷剑等），和本部的伙伴一起热身，讨论，学习或训练剑技，周常活动的最后也会开展讲手或自由对抗，互相增进友谊，取长补短提升自己的剑术。剑道部的初学者社员会在老社员的带领下从分解动作，发力，从单击动作到连击动作逐渐进入连锁式的练习，达到一定熟练度后也会转入密集型的冲击训练，因社团周常活动时间不足以支持剑道训练，剑道部也会定期带领社员前往道馆进行加训，技术成熟后进行上甲对抗或比赛。每年社团也会开展两大年度活动，分别是新社员全校范围内的兵赛与最后一次周常活动的整活大赛，意在让全校师生体验剑的魅力，加深同学间的友谊。

西浦剑协自成立以来秉承“以道修心，以武修身”的理念，在大家的努力下，致力于传播剑术的武道精神文化，与剑道赛事的推广。无论你是大佬还是萌新，我们都会热烈欢迎你的到来。

Xian Jiaotong Liverpool university HMA&Kendo Club, referred to as XJTLU HMA&Kendo Club, was established in 2017. In the early days of its establishment, the society was strongly supported by the school and swordsmanship lovers from all over the world. Now it has a stable and good practice system, safety equipment and environment.

The club is divided into HMA department and kendo department. The HMA Department "reconstructs" various historical Wushu systems through historical materials, and learns, practices and confronts them. The Kendo Department practices Kendo as a traditional competitive instrument martial arts. Through systematic training and one-on-one competition, the winner and loser can be obtained by scoring. The members of the two departments maintain a long-term friendly and close relationship, and will also regularly organize League building activities together.

Our club activities are also very rich and colorful. After selecting the arms that they want to learn or experience (the arms that the club currently offers are divided into East Asia long saber, German long sword, British saber, Italian swift sword, etc.), the members of the HMA   department will warm up, discuss, learn or train sword skills with the partners of the department. At the end of the weekly activities, they will also carry out hands-on or free confrontation to enhance friendship and learn from each other to improve their sword skills. Under the leadership of the old members, the novice members of the Kendo department will gradually enter the chain practice from breaking down actions and exerting force, from click action to combo action. After reaching a certain level of proficiency, they will also switch to intensive impact training. Because the regular activity time of the club is not enough to support kendo training, the Kendo department will also regularly lead the members to the Taoist hall for additional training. When the skills are mature, they will compete with each other or compete. Every year, the club will also carry out two annual activities, namely, the new members' school wide military competition and the last weekly activity competition, which are intended to let all teachers and students experience the charm of sword and deepen the friendship between students.

Since its establishment, XJTLU HMA&Kendo Club has been adhering to the concept of "Use the art to hone the will, exercise the body with martial". With everyone's efforts, XJTLU HMA&Kendo Club is committed to spreading the martial spirit and culture of fencing and promoting Kendo competitions. Whether you are a master or new one, we will warmly welcome you.
